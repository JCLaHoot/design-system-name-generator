So... I accidentaly wiped the database while working on the redesigned version of this (see https://www.figma.com/file/vPnn3vxQwqK9PixQ3oPhMH/Design-System-Name-Generator-%F0%9F%8F%AD?node-id=1059%3A20414&t=Z0Uig2Yvs9q0MPOf-1 )

Use this tool to figure out a name for your design system, based on the values that are important to you and your organisation.

## Word tagging machine:
Repo: https://github.com/JCLaHoot/name-tagging-system

https://tagging.designsystem.name/

Words are ranked against values here. By ranking words, you increase the accuracy of the tool!

You can also add new words.

## I want to add a value
Submit an issue with the name of the value and a fontawesome icon to go with it, and every so often I'll add more 😄
